          Hello world, and welcome to my first website! This is a 90's inspired project I am working
          on, while studying interaction design in Oslo. On this site you can read about how to live your best life, the right way. Also called <i>The Caroline Way.</i>
          We will go through a brief history, some fun-facts, and then the ten commandments. Good luck, and enjoy! <marquee>All the statements you are about to read are in no way
            or form representet by Kristiania, sorry for the inconvenience.</marquee>

       <blockquote>"Man maa ingenting"</blockquote>
       <p>I was born on april fool's day in 1998, way up north. My family and myself are originally sapmi people, but I don't speak a word sapmi. I do however speak spanish fluently,
           because I was studying in Madrid before moving to Oslo. I have been playing the french horn for 10 years, and I started shooting guns when I was twelve.
           I started studying IxD because I am a creative person that finds technology interesting. I am hoping to become a kick-ass 
           interaction designer that can code fast and make everything look aesthetically pleasing. So far it is not looking promising.
       </p>

       <h3 style="color:darkcyan">The ten commandments</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Eat kidney beans instead of meat in your tacos, you can spend the money on extra guacamole.</li>
           <li>Combing your hair is overrated, sleep an extra 5 minutes.</li>
           <li>Don't bother having pretty long nails, they will break you.</li>
           <li>Sit in the serviced carrige when taking the train, less people.</li>
           <li>Don't bleach your hair, it will also break you.</li>
           <li>If your boss is terrible, write a 3000 word letter to his boss.</li>
           <li>Don't buy tobacco, it's expensive and not worth it.</li>
           <li>Look for solutions, not problems.</li>
           <li>Tell your costumers a joke, they will tip you.</li>
           <li>Wake up every day knowing that you will go back to bed at some point.</li>
       </ul>
       </break>
